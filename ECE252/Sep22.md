## Intrinsic Semiconductor

a semiconductor in which there is a balance between the number of electrons in the conduction band and the number of the holes in the valence band is called an intrinsic semiconductor



## P-type and N-type semiconductor

Depending upon the type of ipurity added, extrinsic semiconductor are classified in to two types

**N-Type**

**P-Type**

## Transistor

A tansistor is a semiconductor device used to switch electronic signals as well as electrical power.

The transistor is the fundamental building block of modern electronic devices.

### CMOS

Basi Logic Gate of Computer

## Transistor 
Miscroprocessors contain millions of transistors

 - Intel Pentium II: 7 Millions
 - Intel Pentium III: 28 Millions

Logically, each transistor acts as a switch

Combined to implement login functions:
 - AND, OR, NOT
## P-type MOS Transistor
P-type is complementary ro N-type 
 - when Gate has positive voltage, open circuit between #1 and #2 (SWITCH OPEN)
 - when Gate has zero voltage, short circuit between $1 and #2 (SWITCH CLOSED)

## N-type MOS 
MOS = Metal Oxide Semiconductor
Opposite to P

## CMOS Circuit
Complementary MOS


For all inputs make sure that ouput is either conected the GND or + BUT NOT BOTH!
### Inverter (NOT GATE)

Contains one P and one N type transistor

Ouput the inverse signal of the input signal
